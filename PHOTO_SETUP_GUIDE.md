## 💡 IF IMAGE DOESN'T SHOW

**Problem:** Photo not displaying after 3 minutes

**Solutions:**
1. **Check filename:** Must be exactly `profile.jpg` (lowercase)
2. **Check location:** File must be in root of repo (same folder as index.html)
3. **Hard refresh:** Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
4. **Wait longer:** Sometimes takes 5-10 minutes for large images
5. **Check file size:** Image should be under 1MB (compress if needed)
